# Trigger actions by score

**Who**

Administrators

**What**

Need to be able to trigger an action by score

**Why**

Supervisors might need to do something if an score is out of range.

For example in Beating the Blues the supervisors should be made aware if a user has a PHQ-9 result of greater than 20. Beating the Blues is a treatment option for people with mild to moderate depression, anything higher than 20 is considered severe. Supervisors should be informed so that they can consider alternative treatments. Supervisors should also be made aware of a user that has a score of less than 4, anything less than 4 is considered minimal depression. In early sessions this is might indicate a misdiagnosis in later session this might indicate a successful treatment.

**Details**

The possibilities are:

- greater than
- smaller than
