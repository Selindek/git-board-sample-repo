# Download data

**Administrator** downloads module data to create custom reports that are not available in the product.

- [DSV format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delimiter-separated_values), use pipe as delimiter
- data sheet should be configured by course manager to return all data for all available reports at minimum
- only the first data sheet: multiple data exports later
